# Autonomous Times

Opinions are wonderful. The infrastructure to share, collaborate and publish opinions should be neutral, as in void of opinions and autonomous as in not dependent on single people, i.e. sufficiently decentralised. 

The illusionary contradiction here is that with neutral infrastructure, ownership and agency of authors is much greater. Publishing or rather being part of publishing is making decisions in a collaborative setting. 

This is the project i keep coming back to: a comprehensive approach to collaborative writing and publishing

So, what we'r exploring is: primitives for sharing of markdown texts that are:

* versioned
* encrypted
* can be shared, collaborated upon
* agnostic to editors

* ownership is registered on chain 
* authors can make on chain deals with publishers that do not transfer, but share ownership 
* these deals can be temporary and/or rescinded by both parties

* publishers are structured as on chain decentralised autonomous organisations
* html is generated and deleted by a neutral static site generator acting on on-chain deals
* webhosting is provided by marketplace of compute providers.
